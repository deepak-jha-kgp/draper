# Rebuild the app and publish its output as the bundle's app source.
#
# `apps/brand-studio/source/` is a **prebuilt static site**, not a Vite project, and
# that is the whole reason a fresh pod is set up in seconds. The CLI picks an app
# tier by what it finds there: a `package.json` means "Vite" — npm install, npm
# build, and three required VITE_LEMMA_* env vars, none of which a fresh pod has.
# An `index.html` with no `package.json` means "static": uploaded as-is, no build,
# no env. The bundle ships the second one.
#
# Nothing pod-specific may be baked in. The host injects window.__LEMMA_CONFIG__
# at serve time, so the same bytes serve any pod on any server — but Vite inlines
# `import.meta.env.*` at build time from BOTH the process environment and any
# .env file on disk. `lemma pods export` carries `.env.local` out of a pod's app
# source, so that file arrives holding the pod id it was exported from. Hence the
# two defences below: the env files are moved aside for the build, and the output
# is refused if a uuid or an internal host survived anyway.
